# Machine Learning for EDS Data Decomposition 
Machine Learning Course Project 2

## Overview
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS, EDX or XEDS) \cite{myScope} is a qualitative and quantitative X-ray microanalytical technique that can provide information on the chemical composition of a sample. An electron beam is focussed on the sample. The electrons from the primary beam penetrate the sample and interact with the atoms from which it is made. Two types of X-rays result from these interactions: Bremsstrahlung X-rays, which means ‘braking radiation’ and are also referred to as Continuum or background X-rays, and Characteristic X-rays. The X-rays are detected by an Energy Dispersive detector which displays the signal as a spectrum, or histogram, of intensity (number of X-rays or X-ray count rate) versus X-ray energy. The energies of the Characteristic X-rays allow the elements making up the sample to be identified, while the intensities of the Characteristic X-ray peaks allow the concentrations of the elements to be quantified. Given the EDS Data of a sample, this project aims to obtain the spectrum of the pure elements present in the sample as well as their relative concentrations at each pixel.
