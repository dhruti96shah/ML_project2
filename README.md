# Machine Learning for EDS Data Decomposition 
Machine Learning Course Project 2

## Overview
Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS, EDX or XEDS) is a qualitative and quantitative X-ray microanalytical technique that can provide information on the chemical composition of a sample. The energies of the Characteristic X-rays allow the elements making up the sample to be identified, while the intensities of the Characteristic X-ray peaks allow the concentrations of the elements to be quantified. Given the EDS Data of a sample, this project aims to obtain the spectrum of the pure elements present in the sample as well as their relative concentrations at each pixel.

## Libraries Required and installation
1. [Hyperspy](https://hyperspy.org/): HyperSpy is an open source Python library which provides tools to facilitate the interactive data analysis of multi-dimensional datasets that can be described as multi-dimensional arrays of a given signal.To install, run the following commands in the terminal:
``` conda install hyperspy -c conda-forge '''
